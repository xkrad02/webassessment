### Reflections

- What did you like about this project?
Being able to work on something new seems really fun and challenging at the same time. I feel a little sense of achievement when I am able to create something new.

- What did you struggle with in this project?
For the mobile view, the use of <picture> tag for responsive design caused my initial image size at css to not work properly. I had to keep trying different ways to change it back to how it was before. Took me really long :( It was also really difficult to find solutions for this problem online too. But luckily eventually I could still figure it out on my own. 

- What would make your experience with this assessment better?
I feel that all is good.
