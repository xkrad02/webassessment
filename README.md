# Web Assessment: Colmar Academy

# Reflection

## What did you like about this project?
Being able to work on something new seems really fun and challenging at the same time. I feel some sense of achievement when I am able to create new website layouts.

## What did you struggle with in this project?
For the mobile view, the use of <picture> tag for responsive design caused my initial image size at css to not work properly. I had to keep trying different ways to change it back to how it was before.
  
## What would make your experience with this assessment better?
Do more practice on my own to familiarize myself with the concepts, so I can better execute them in the assessment.
